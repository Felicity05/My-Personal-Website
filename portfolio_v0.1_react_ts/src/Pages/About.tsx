          <p>Hello, my name is Arelys Alvarez.
              I’m a Software Engineer based in the New York Metropolitan area with a passion for coding and design.

              I’ve been a professional developer for a year and I have experience in different domains, such as education,
              research and development, technology and finance.

              When I’m not coding, I love cooking, traveling and spending time with my family and friends!

              You can check out some of my personal projects here!</p>
